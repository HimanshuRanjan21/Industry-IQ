**This is a hour-level time-series data of the complete year 2023.

Bucket: A logical container for time series data in InfluxDB. Here, it's named "plant," presumably representing data related to a plant or industrial facility.

Measurement: A collection of fields and tags representing a specific type of data. In this case, it's "tag_data," which could indicate metadata or descriptive tags associated with sensor readings.

Field: The actual data value being measured or recorded. The field here is "_value," which may store numerical or textual data representing various sensor readings or measurements.

Tags: Metadata or labels providing additional context to the data. Tags are key-value pairs that help in organizing and querying the data efficiently. In this schema:

sensor_data: A tag categorizing the type of sensor data being collected. It has multiple possible values, each representing a different area or aspect of the plant (utilities, hydro, crude, overall).

sensor_id: Another tag specifying the specific sensor or parameter being measured within each area. For example, in "utilities_AREA," sensor_id can represent parameters like electricity consumption, steam generation rate, water consumption, etc.
